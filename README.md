# ImageLabelingDeepLearning


Here in this Project I classify the images into four Classes Misc,Food,Attire,DecorationSignage.
I used CNN(Convolutional Neural network) to train my model.
Firstly i convert the Images to numpy array Because we can not give Images as a input to CNN directly.
I used Flow from directory to get my Images arrays into csv file having lables of each images.
And then split my data into x_train and y_train to train my model usind CNN.
Then claculate my score on Test data.
